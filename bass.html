<h2>introduction</h2>
<img src="bass.jpg" width="15%">
<p>The <strong>bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass</strong> is the lowest-pitched member of the string family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.

<h3>scale</h3>
<p>
The scale of the bass is located along the length of the string and forms what is known as the <u>fingerboard.</u> The scale can range in length but is traditionally 34-35 inches long while "short scale" bass guitars are usually between 30 and 32 inches.
